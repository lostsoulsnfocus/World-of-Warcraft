--------------------

Shefki:
	- Oops duplicated a line unintentionally.
	- Add support for warlock green fire to the BurningEmbers module.
	- Set the extra2 value to 0 for other bar modules (prevents ghost extra values from showing up when bars get reused).
	- Add support for showing absorbs in the VisualHeal module.
	- Add a 2nd extra bar to BetterStatusBar.
	- Return to old style menus for raid frames since Blizzard has a bug in the new menu system.  Includes a somewhat ugly hack around Clique forcing the use of the new menu system.
	- Display friendships properly in the ReptutationBar & LuaTexts.
	- Remove pre-5.1 compatibility from Aura Filters.
	- Remove pre 5.1 support from Chi module.
	- Remove pre-mop compatibility from UnitFrame.lua

	- Just stop using MAX_ARENA_TEAM_MEMBERS entirely, it wasn't really the right constant anyway.
