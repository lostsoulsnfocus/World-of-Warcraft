Tag as 3.1.2


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Add monk channeled spells
	- Update TOC for 5.2
	- Cleanup after a3cd5d9
Benjamin Staneck:
	- remove pre-mop combat and add mind flay: insanity to the list of channeled spells
Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Bump toc
	- Fix latency showing wrong information when using world objects or crafting.
	The latency display requires a fixed order of events,
	if some of these events don't happen, the information is bogus,
	so instead of trying to use it anyway, clear it, and ensure its
	only displayed when its meaningful.
